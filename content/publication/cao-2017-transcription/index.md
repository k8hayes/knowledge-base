abstract: "We aim to address one question: do cancer vs. normal tissue cells execute their transcription regulation essentially the same or differently, and why? We utilized an integrated computational study of cancer epigenomes and transcriptomes of 10 cancer types, by using penalized linear regression models to evaluate the regulatory effects of DNA methylations on gene expressions."
