title: "Nonparametric Methods"
linktitle: "Nonparametric Statistics"
summary: We will start with an overview of some fundamentals of nonparametric statistics. Then we will consider in turn methods for a single sample, for two samples, and for multiple samples. This will be followed by discussion of correlation, concordance, and regression, as well as association and other related methods for categorical data. Finally, we will look at a variety of more "modern" nonparametric methods, such as the bootstrap and kernel density estimation.

These are the notes I took for a Master's course **Nonparametric Methods**. The recommended textbook is _Applied Nonparametric Statistical Methods, Fourth Edition_ by Sprent, P. and Smeeton, N.C. (2007).

First, we're going to introduce some [basic concepts in nonparametric statistics]({{< ref "/series/nonparam-stat/1-introduction/1.1-basic-concepts/index.md" >}}).
